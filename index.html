          <h3>Our History</h3>
          <p>
            Born out of the devastation of the 1994 Genocide, Zulfat Foundation was founded in 2008 with a mission to restore dignity and opportunity to those who had been forgotten. Our humble beginnings as a grassroots initiative have evolved into a respected organization that serves hundreds of communities across Rwanda.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, we have celebrated numerous milestones:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Establishment of our first community learning center in 2009.</li>
            <li>Launch of vocational training programs in 2011, which have since trained over 500 individuals.</li>
            <li>Expansion of our scholarship fund in 2013, enabling access to higher education for hundreds of students.</li>
            <li>Partnerships with international organizations starting in 2015, expanding our reach and resources.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Our history is a testament to the strength and resilience of the Rwandan people, and it continues to inspire us to push the boundaries of what is possible.
